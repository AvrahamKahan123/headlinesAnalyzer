# headlinesAnalyzer
Incomplete. News and Twitter analyzer using ElasticSearch and python Natural Language Processing Modules
# explanation
See overview.txt for explanation of program structure module by module
This program attempts to understand the interaction between the news, news sites and social media. 
First, it scrapes several news-sites using BeautifulSoup and saves these results to a PostgreSQL db. The programs are then parsed and analyzed with the help of the spaCy machine learning module and precreated postgres tables to extract related names, places, and organizations. Then, the program extracts topics with the help of the Latent Dirchet Allocation algorithm from Scikit-learn.The topics are then indexed by elasticsearch. The articles are then mapped to the topics by searching against the topics. Elasticsearch is used to do this, instead of just seeing how LDA constructed its topics, because Elasticsearch is more capable of providing similarity scores and determining whether a document truly belongs to a topic cluster. At this point the Twitter API is used to generate streams of tweets filtered on keywords in the topics (ex. "BLM", "Police" and "Portland" could be keywords for one cluster). These tweets are then sentiment analyzed (ie. are the tweets positive or negative) with the help of the TextBlob module. These results are then stored in postgreSQL for easy retrieval whenever desired. 
New topics are generated from scratch every set time interval, and during that interval new headlines can be classified by searching their titles against the topics index
The program makes use of a great deal of data to parse the Headlines for names and places. This data is stored mostly in postgreSQL tables. This data is neccesary since testing showed that Machine Learning modules are usually not very good at telling the difference between last names, organizations, and places (ex. in one test, "Biden" was characterized as a 'geopolitical entity')
The program adds values and names to the database by scraping the web (this feature is complete for names already) automatically

# current state
The web-scraper is complete. The PostgreSQL tables holding Countries, Celebrities, etc. are still under construction, but are largely filled with data. The elasticsearch index for the articles and topics have been created already but code to index the tppics and articles has not been written yet. The parser for headlines to extract places, people, organizations is under construction. The twitter stream modules are almost complete. The LDA algorithm has not been implemented yet.
